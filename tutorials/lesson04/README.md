### GPIO Drivers

In this tutorial I will take about how to access the gpio pins. To my help I had [Blackfin GPIO drivers](http://blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=gpio).

There is the [recommended linux way of accessing pins](gpioblink_safe/README.md) (by using the gpio api), however one coming from close to hardware programming might wish to use a different approach.
For those rare circumstances there is the [unrecommended direct hardware approach](gpioblink_unsafe/README.md)
